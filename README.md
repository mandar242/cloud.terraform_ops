## Installation

To consume this Validated Content from Automation Hub, please ensure that you add the following lines to your ansible.cfg file.

```
[galaxy]
server_list = automation_hub

[galaxy_server.automation_hub]
url=https://cloud.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/
auth_url=https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token
token=<SuperSecretToken>
```
The token can be obtained from the [Automation Hub Web UI](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/token).

Once the above steps are done, you can run the following command to install the collection.

```
ansible-galaxy collection install cloud.terraform_ops
```

## Use Cases

Once installed, you can reference the cloud.terraform_ops collection content by its fully qualified collection name (FQCN), for example:

```yaml
  # create the necessary AWS infrastructure for an S3 remote backend for Terraform.
  - hosts: all

    roles:
      - role: cloud.terraform_ops.aws_s3backend
        aws_s3backend_bucket_name: sample_bucket_for_tf_backend

  # Use plan_stash role to store the plan
  - hosts: localhost
    gather_facts: true
    vars:
      plan_stash_var_name_val: my_test_stashed_plan
      plan_stash_plan_file_name_val: /path/to/plan/file/to/read/stash/myplan.tfplan
    tasks:
      - name: Generate planfile by running Terraform plan
        cloud.terraform.terraform:
          project_path: /path/to/tf/project/directory/
          force_init: true
          plan_file: "{{ plan_stash_generate_plan_file_name_val }}"
          state: present

      - name: Stash the Terraform plan file into variable "{{ plan_stash_var_name_val }}"
        ansible.builtin.include_role:
          name: cloud.terraform_ops.plan_stash
        vars:
          plan_stash_operation: stash
          plan_stash_var_name: "{{ plan_stash_var_name_val }}" # if not provided, defaults to "terraform_plan"
          plan_stash_plan_file_path: "{{ plan_stash_generate_plan_file_name_val }}"
```

## Contributing to this collection

We welcome community contributions to this collection. If you find problems, please open an issue or create a PR against this collection repository.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/redhat-cop/cloud.terraform_ops/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

## Testing

The project uses `ansible-lint` and `black`.
Assuming this repository is checked out in the proper structure,
e.g. `collections_root/ansible_collections/cloud/terraform_ops/`, run:

```shell
  tox -e linters -vv
```

Sanity and unit tests are run as normal:

```shell
  ansible-test sanity
```

If you want to run AWS cloud integration tests, ensure you log in :

```shell
# using the "default" profile on AWS
  aws configure set aws_access_key_id     my-access-key
  aws configure set aws_secret_access_key my-secret-key
  aws configure set region                eu-north-1

```

Once credentials are set up, run all integration tests with `ansible-test integration` or run a subset of integration tests with `ansible-test integration <target>`.

This collection is tested using GitHub Actions. To know more about CI, refer to [CI.md](https://github.com/https://github.com/redhat-cop/cloud.terraform_ops/blob/main/CI.md).
